## 🤔 What is PromptBuilder?

Think of PromptBuilder as **"PowerPoint for AI"** - instead of making slides, you create AI workflows by dragging and dropping boxes and connecting them with lines. No coding required!

### Real-World Example:
Imagine you want AI to:
1. Read your emails
2. Find the important ones
3. Write summaries
4. Send them to Slack

With PromptBuilder, you just drag 4 boxes, connect them with arrows, and click "Run"!

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- **Small Business Owners** who want to use AI without hiring programmers
- **Marketing Teams** who need to create content at scale
- **Customer Service** departments wanting to automate responses
- **Anyone** who thinks AI is too complicated right now

## 🛠️ Current Development Status

### The Foundation (90% Complete) ✅
- All the technical infrastructure is built
- Database is designed and ready
- Visual designer works great
- Connection to n8n (the automation engine) is coded

### The User Experience (20% Complete) ⚠️
- You can see the visual designer
- You can drag and drop nodes
- But you can't save your work
- And you can't run workflows yet

### The Polish (5% Complete) ❌
- No user accounts yet
- No cost tracking
- No workflow sharing
- No templates library

## 🎨 What Can You Do With It Today?

### ✅ You CAN:
1. **See the Homepage** - Visit http://localhost:3000 to see what it will look like
2. **Play with the Designer** - Go to /designer to drag and drop workflow nodes
3. **Explore the Code** - Everything is organized and documented

### ❌ You CANNOT (yet):
1. **Create an Account** - No login system yet
2. **Save a Workflow** - It disappears when you refresh
3. **Run a Workflow** - The execute button doesn't connect to anything
4. **See Results** - No way to view what happened

## 🚦 Getting Started (For Non-Techies)

### What You Need First:
1. **Node.js** - This runs JavaScript on your computer
2. **Docker** - This runs n8n (the automation engine)
3. **A Terminal** - The black window where you type commands

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1. **Download the Code**
   ```
   Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
   Choose "Download ZIP"
   Unzip it somewhere on your computer
   ```

2. **Open Terminal** (Command Prompt on Windows)
   ```
   Navigate to the PromptBuilder folder
   Type: cd /path/to/PromptBuilder
   ```

3. **Install Everything**
   ```
   Type: npm install
   Wait for it to finish (might take 5 minutes)
   ```

4. **Start the Project**
   ```
   Type: npm run dev
   Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Details (For Developers)

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Visual Workflows**: React Flow
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), tRPC
- **Automation**: n8n (Docker container)
- **Real-time**: Yjs (not connected yet)

### Key Integrations:
- ✅ OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- ✅ Anthropic (Claude)
- ✅ Google (Gemini)
- ⚠️ Credentials management not built yet

### n8n Status:
- ✅ Translation service written (`workflowTranslator.ts`)
- ✅ Execution service written (`workflowExecutor.ts`)
- ✅ API client written (`n8nClient.ts`)
- ❌ Never tested end-to-end
- ❌ No error handling for failures

## 📊 Database Design (Already Built!)

We have 10 tables ready to go:
- `organizations` - Companies using the platform
- `prompt_chains` - Your saved workflows
- `chain_executions` - History of runs
- `execution_nodes` - Details of each step
- `prompt_templates` - Reusable prompts
- `marketplace_templates` - Shared workflows
- `analytics_aggregate` - Usage statistics
- `system_settings` - Configuration
- `ab_experiments` - Testing features
- `ab_variants` - Different versions

## 🎯 Next Steps (What's Being Built Next)

### Phase 1: Make It Usable (Current Focus)
1. Add login/signup pages
2. Make workflows save to database
3. Connect the "Execute" button
4. Show execution results

### Phase 2: Make It Useful
1. Add cost tracking
2. Create workflow templates
3. Enable sharing workflows
4. Add team collaboration

### Phase 3: Make It Awesome
1. Marketplace for buying/selling workflows
2. Advanced analytics dashboard
3. Mobile app
4. API for developers

## 🆘 Common Questions

### "Is this ready to use?"
Not yet! It's like a car with an engine but no steering wheel. The hard parts are done, but you can't drive it yet.

### "When will it be ready?"
Core features: 2-3 months
Full platform: 6-8 months

### "Can I help?"
Yes! Even non-techies can:
- Test the interface
- Suggest features
- Report confusing parts
- Share workflow ideas

### "What's n8n?"
n8n is like Zapier - it connects different services together. We use it to actually run your AI workflows.

### "Why can't I log in?"
The login system isn't built yet. The database is ready for users, but there's no way to create an account.

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Workflows Don't Save** - Everything disappears on refresh
2. **No Error Messages** - When things fail, nothing tells you
3. **Execute Button Does Nothing** - It's just for show right now
4. **No Mobile Support** - Only works on desktop
5. **No Cost Estimates** - Can't see how much AI calls will cost

## 📞 Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request features
- **Documentation**: More coming soon!
- **Email**: Not set up yet

## 🎉 Fun Facts

- The entire n8n integration was written in one session!
- The visual designer works perfectly but doesn't connect to anything
- The database can handle millions of workflows (but stores zero right now)
- All the security features are built in, even though there are no users yet

**Remember**: This is a work in progress. It's like a house where the foundation and framing are done, but there's no drywall, plumbing, or electricity yet. The hard parts are complete - now we need to make it pretty and usable!

<Jimmy>, this project is going to revolutionize how non-technical people use AI. You're building the "missing piece" between powerful AI and everyday users. Keep going! 🚀
